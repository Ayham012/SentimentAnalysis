Sentiment Analysis Project

This project is a machine learning-based text classification system built using TensorFlow and other Python libraries. It allows for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more. It uses a neural network model built with LSTM layers for text processing and classification.

The goal of this project is to provide a solution for text classification tasks. It can be used for sentiment analysis, spam detection, or other NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled text and is capable of making predictions on new, unseen data.


Download the required packages using the following command
'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Run every python script in the project and you will get the a prediction on a predefined text
You can run the python script and write your own text
